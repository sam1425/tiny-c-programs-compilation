# Mate
Still not super stable but there are running tests for most platforms. It's already useable and should serve 99% of your builds as far as your manage dependencies.

## About
Mate is a build system for C in C and all you need to run it is a C compiler, if you want to learn more about it check out our [examples](./examples) which should
teach you everything you need to know to use it, here is a simple example of a `mate.c`:

```c 
#define MATE_IMPLEMENTATION // Adds function implementations 
#include "mate.h"

i32 main() {
  StartBuild();
  {
    Executable executable = CreateExecutable((ExecutableOptions){
        .output = "main",   // output name, in windows this becomes `main.exe` automatically
        .flags = "-Wall -g" // adds warnings and debug symbols
    });

    // Files to compile
    AddFile(executable, "./src/main.c");

    // Compiles all files parallely with samurai
    InstallExecutable(executable);

    // Runs `./build/main` or `./build/main.exe` depending on the platform
    RunCommand(executable.outputPath);
  }
  EndBuild();
}
```

To use it all you need is [mate.h](./mate.h) file on the same folder you have the `mate.c` example file and you can run by `gcc ./mate.c -o ./mate && ./mate`, after running once
it will auto detect if you need to rebuild based on `mate-cache.ini`, so you can just run `./mate` directly and it'll rebuild itself.

Under the hood we use [Samurai](https://github.com/michaelforney/samurai) which is a ninja rewrite in C, we boostrapped it to `mate.h` and compile it on the first run, after that
it is cached and thanks to it builds are extremely fast (because of it the first build usually takes a bit longer but on the second one it should be very fast). If you want even faster 
builds, you can use [TCC](https://bellard.org/tcc/) which is a tinier and faster C compiler, on medium sized projects our builds go from `600ms` to `20ms` because `tcc` was made to be 
**very fast** to compile.

## Operating Systems
| OS | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Linux** | ✅ Supported | Uses [Samurai](https://github.com/michaelforney/samurai) under the hood |
| **Windows** | ✅ Supported | Requires Ninja build system (Samurai [in progress](https://github.com/TomasBorquez/mate.h/issues/2)) |
| **macOS** | ⚠️ Supported | Limited testing done |

## Compilers
| Compiler | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [**GCC**](https://gcc.gnu.org/) | ✅ Supported | Primary development target with best support |
| [**Clang**](https://releases.llvm.org/) | ✅ Supported | Works perfectly well too |
| [**TinyC**](https://bellard.org/tcc/) | ✅ Supported | Recommended if you want fast compile times |
| [**MSVC**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) | ⚠️ Supported | Limiting testing done, MinGW is recommended instead |
