# About:
C lacks a proper standard library so I decided to create a proper one that makes it easier for me to get started on a project
and have the necessary default functions by default.

It is cross-platform and works on `windows`, `linux` and `Freebsd` (no support for `macos` yet) as well as in many compilers like `gcc`, `clang` and `tcc` (doesn't yet support `MSVC`).
This is still very much experimental and if used you should read `base.h` implementations and assume they might have bugs, I strongly recommend to just use as inspiration
or recreationally until version 1.0.

I will add features as I need them and fix stuff as I break it, backwards compatibility is not garanteed either until 1.0.

## Features:
- `Defer` - It works similar to Go's defer it only works on `gcc` and `clang` with `-fblocks` flag (`MSVC` doesnt support this yet nor does `tcc`, and they probably wont until C23/C26+)
```c
#define DEFER_DEFINITION // Must define this macro

i32 *ptr = (i32 *) malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
defer {
  free(ptr); // will execute at the end
}
```
- `Vector` - In here you have `VecPush`, `VecShift`, `VecUnshift`, etc. It's just a regular macro implementation.
- `Arenas` - Based on Ginger Bill's arena implemenation.
- `String` - Some basic string functions.
- `File System` - Some abstractions for both `windows` and `linux` for files.
- And more...

## Usage:

A good way to keep this updated is by using git submodules, you can add `base.h` like this:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/TomasBorquez/base.h.git ./vendor/base
```

This will add `base.h` to `./vendor`, then you can include it from there or add a `-I"./vendor/base"` flag when compiling and importing like:

```C
#define BASE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "base.h"
```

And for keeping it updated you can:

```C
git submodule update --init
```
